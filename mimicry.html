        <h1>Mimicry by <span class="name-hi">Piyush</span></h1>
        <p>
          My name is Piyush Talegaonkar. Being a film enthusiast, I am learning
          to be a part time filmmaker. The mimicry is an attempt proceeding in
          the process. The performance is a mimicry of Dr. Prashant Umape Sir
          and Pankaj Patil Sir. Here, Patil sir's beautiful handwriting provokes
          him to use it for more artistic purposes and to challenge his thought
          is the more scientifically driven Umape sir. What follows is a
          hilarious back and forth between the both of them, in an attempt for
          both of them to justify themselves. In the end I would like to express
          to all the professors that we love them very much and you have formed
          a lot of beautiful parts of our memory.
